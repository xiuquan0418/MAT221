This exam contains \numpages\ pages (including this cover page) and
\numquestions\ problems.  Check to see if any pages are missing.  Enter
all requested information on the top of this page, and put your initials
on the top of every page, in case the pages become separated.\\

You may \textit{not} use your books, notes, or any calculator on this exam.\\

You are required to show your work on each problem on this exam.  The following rules apply:\\

\begin{minipage}[t]{3.7in}
\vspace{0pt}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{If you use a ``fundamental theorem'' you must indicate this} and explain
why the theorem may be applied.

\item \textbf{Organize your work}, in a reasonably neat and coherent way, in
the space provided. Work scattered all over the page without a clear ordering will 
receive very little credit.  

\item \textbf{Mysterious or unsupported answers will not receive full
credit}.  A correct answer, unsupported by calculations, explanation,
or algebraic work will receive no credit; an incorrect answer supported
by substantially correct calculations and explanations might still receive
partial credit.


\item If you need more space, use the back of the pages; clearly indicate when you have done this.
\end{itemize}

Do not write in the table to the right.
