# Information on Calculus Classes: 
<ul>
<li> WebAssign: <br> For Fall 2020, we’re now using the 8th edition of the textbook and may require use of WebAssign in Calculus sections.  </li>
<li> options to buy the course textbook: <br> This is available as a package consisting of the book and 6 months access to WebAssign from the publisher for $171.95, with ISBN number 9781305616691. The same package is available at the bookstore and from other sellers, possibly with a lower price. If you already have a copy of the book, or only want an electronic version, you can get this together with Cengage Unlimited from the publisher for $119.99. Note that this price includes access to all textbooks in the Cengage library, some of which may be used in other Tougaloo courses. If WebAssign will not be used in your section, and you don’t want to purchase access, it is possibly to rent the text (for $47.49) or purchase access to the ebook (for which the price ranges from $29.99 to $47.49 depending on the duration of access).

Access to WebAssign and the eBook version of the textbook for one semester can be purchased directly from WebAssign after enrolling in the appropriate class there. The price is $100 for one semester, $125 for multiple terms (usable if you take more than one semester of Calculus). Cengage Unlimited includes access to WebAssign. It is no longer possible to purchase just access to WebAssign, it is sold together with the eBook. </li>
